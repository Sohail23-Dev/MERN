JS Runtime Environment: 
                        1. JS Engine(V8)  --> Call Stack 
                        2. Web Apis
                        3. Call Back Queue 
                        4. Micro Tasks Queue
                        5. Event Loops


JS Engine(V8): 
Parsing -----> Compile ------> Execute
        (Process of mark and sweep) Garbage in Java

GEC (Global Execuation Context) is always running in JS file without even a single line of JS (Anonymus function)

            1. It performs Tree formation :- AST (Abstract Systax Tree)
